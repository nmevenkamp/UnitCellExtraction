  "body": "### Primitive Unit Cell Extraction\r\n\r\n__Version 2.0__\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this code is unsupervised and accurate primitive unit cell extraction from crystal images. The method and code was developed for crystallographers and material scientists. However, it is designed to find the symmetry axes and corresponding periods in generic periodic images and could therefore be of use in other applications as well.\r\n___\r\nThe program is intended to be executed in a terminal using a text file to specify the input file and output directory.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](README.txt) for instructions on how to compile and run.\r\n___\r\n**LICENSE**: This code is distributed under the terms of the [Common Development and Distribution License](LICENSE.txt).  \r\nParticularly, you can **download and use** this software **free of cost**.  \r\n   \r\nWe appreciate any feedback on your experience with this program. In case you encounter any problems, please don't hesitate to contact us: [mevenkamp@aices.rwth-aachen.de](mailto:mevenkamp@aices.rwth-aachen.de)\r\n___\r\nIf you use our code in the context of a publication, please refer to our related work:\r\n\r\n**[1]** N.
