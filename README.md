### Primitive Unit Cell Extraction

__Version 2.0__

The main purpose of this code is unsupervised and accurate primitive unit cell extraction from crystal images. The method and code was developed for crystallographers and material scientists. However, it is designed to find the symmetry axes and corresponding periods in generic periodic images and could therefore be of use in other applications as well.
